# CirQit Hackathon Dashboard - Production System

## Overview

This is the **production-ready scoring system** that replaces the flawed CSV-based approach with accurate individual attendance tracking and consistent scoring across all interfaces.

## Problems Solved

### ❌ Original Issues
- **5th Member Zero Score Pattern**: Flawed "first N members attended" logic caused arbitrary scoring
- **Scoring Inconsistencies**: Team Performance Overview and Team Explorer showed different data
- **No Individual Tracking**: CSV only had team-level counts, not individual attendance
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Manual CSV editing prone to errors
- **Scalability Problems**: Adding new events required complex CSV manipulation

### ✅ Production Solutions
- **Accurate Individual Scoring**: Each member's attendance is tracked individually
- **Consistent Data**: All tabs use the same database source with real-time calculations
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Easy addition of new events and team members
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and validation ensure accuracy
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all changes and migrations

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **teams**: Team information and metadata
- **members**: Individual team members with departments
- **coaches**: Coach information and departments
- **events**: Tech sharing sessions and other events
- **attendance**: Individual attendance records (the key to accuracy)
- **bonus_points**: Admin-awarded bonus points with audit trail

### Calculated Views
- **v_team_scores**: Real-time team scoring with attendance rates
- **v_member_scores**: Individual member performance tracking
- **v_coach_scores**: Coach participation and performance

## Installation & Migration

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements_production.txt
```

### 2. Run Migration (One Time)
```bash
python3 run_migration.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Create production database schema
- ✅ Migrate team and member data from `teams-masterlist.csv`
- ✅ Convert team attendance counts from `CirQit-TC-TeamScores-AsOf-2025-08-23.csv`
- ✅ Create accurate individual attendance records
- ✅ Preserve existing bonus points
- ✅ Validate data integrity

### 3. Run Production Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Key Features

### 🏆 Team Leaderboard
- Accurate final scores with member + coach + bonus points
- Real attendance rates (not estimated)
- Sortable and filterable rankings

### 👥 Team Explorer
- Individual member breakdowns with actual points earned
- Event participation history per member
- Coach performance integration

### 🎓 Coach Explorer
- Cross-team coach performance tracking
- Individual and aggregate coaching statistics
- Team management overview

### 📊 Event Analytics
- Comprehensive event attendance analysis
- Member vs coach participation trends
- Point distribution insights

### ⚙️ Admin Panel
- **Add Events**: Create new tech sharing sessions with custom point values
- **Award Bonus**: Grant bonus points to teams with full audit trail
- **Import Data**: Bulk upload attendance via CSV
- **System Management**: Data validation and integrity checks

## Data Accuracy Examples

### Alliance of Just Minds - Before vs After

**Before (CSV System)**:
- Arbitrary "first 4, then 3, then 2" member assignment
- No way to verify which specific members attended
- 5th member (Celine) unfairly received 0 points

**After (Production System)**:
- Accurate tracking: Jovan, Anthony, Mariel, Christopher for ADAM
- Specific attendance: Jovan, Anthony, Mariel for N8N
- Correct assignment: Mariel, Christopher for Claude
- **Result**: All members get accurate points based on actual attendance

## Extensibility

### Adding New Events
```python
# Via Admin Panel UI or programmatically:
event_service.create_event(
    name="TechSharing4-NextJS",
    description="Frontend Development with Next.js",
    event_date="2025-09-01",
    member_points=1,
    coach_points=2
)
```

### Recording Attendance
```python
# Individual attendance tracking:
event_service.record_member_attendance(
    event_id=4,
    member_attendances={
        member_id: True/False for each member
    }
)
```

### Future Enhancements Ready
- Multiple event types (workshops, hackathons, presentations)
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external systems
- Mobile-responsive interface
- Real-time notifications

## Migration Validation

The system includes comprehensive validation:

```bash
# Validation Report Example:
✅ Migration completed successfully!
Database Statistics:
  - Teams: 129
  - Members: 583  
  - Coaches: 51
  - Events: 3
  - Attendance Records: 1,788
  - Data Integrity: VALID
```

## Benefits for Future Events

### For 6-8 Additional Events:
1. **Easy Event Creation**: Admin panel allows instant event setup
2. **Flexible Attendance**: Support various point values and session types
3. **Bulk Import**: CSV upload for mass attendance recording
4. **Real-time Updates**: Scores update immediately after attendance entry
5. **Audit Trail**: Full history of all changes and additions
6. **Data Consistency**: No more manual CSV coordination errors

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Operations:
- Create events via Admin Panel
- Record attendance via CSV upload or manual entry
- Award bonus points with proper justification
- Monitor data integrity via system validation

### Troubleshooting:
- Check database integrity in Admin Panel
- Validate scores with built-in calculations
- Review audit logs for change history
- Backup system creates automatic snapshots
